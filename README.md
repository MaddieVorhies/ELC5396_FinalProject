# Heart Rate Sensor Project
This project will implement a heart rate sensor from Sparkfun.  

# Description
This project will showcase the abilites of a heart rate sensor and pulse oximeter. The user will attach the sensor to their finger and their heart rate or their oxygen saturation level will be displayed on the seven segment display of the Nexys4DDR board. They will use a button to switch from displaying their heart rate to displaying their oxygen saturations levels. An LED will light up green if their levels are in a healthy range and it will light up red if they are in an unhealthy range.
