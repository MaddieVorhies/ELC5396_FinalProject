# Touch Sensor Project
This project will implement a capacitative touch sensor. 

# Description
This project will showcase the abilites of a capacitative touch sensor. The sensor is able to detect touch, pinch, and spread. These motions can be shown on the seven segment display on the nexys 4 DDR board. Another possible addition to this project is being able to have the LEDs of the board correlate to the movement on the touch screen. For example, if you move your finger across the screen left and right, the LEDs will light up left to right.
